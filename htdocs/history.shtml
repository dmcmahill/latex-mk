    <H2>The Dark Ages</H2>
    <p>
	In the beginning I used M$ word.  It worked for short papers, it was horrible for
	medium to long documents, painful for equations, painful for figures.  Then I learned
	LaTeX and life was much much better.
    </p>
    <H2>The Giant Per-Project Makefile</H2>
    <p>
	In graduate school, a friend showed me a makefile he had set up for his thesis.  It
	contained all sorts of targets and some intellegence about running LaTeX multiple times
	for resolving references.  I made a modified version of that for my thesis and even 
	wrote a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0792375890/qid%3D1004308158/sr%3D8-2/ref%3Dsr%5F8%5F3%5F2/104-1336994-4665513">book</a>
	where I used yet another modified version of that makefile.  This approach was much better
	than doing everything by hand because I had added a lot of functionality over my friends
	makefile.  In particular, my new makefile automatically dealt with tgif figures and I had
	many many figures in the thesis and the book.
    </p><p>
	Despite the utility of the large customized makefile I had, it was not maintainable in the
	sense that every time I started a new document, I'd end up with another copy of a very large 
	makefile to maintain.  If I fixed a bug in one, I'd have several other documents in progress
	which needed updating.
    </p>

    <H2>Enter LaTeX-Mk</H2>
    <p>
	For those of you familiar with the build system used by the BSD operating systems, you'll
	know that for each program, there is a very simple makefile which lists the source files
	along with a couple of other variables which can optionally be set.  Then a system makefile
	called <code>bsd.prog.mk</code> is included.  That included makefile fragment has all the
	code required to provide all the standard targets, sets up the various compiler flags and
	correctly handles all the dependencies.  It is maintainable because the bulk of the code
	is common and only needs to be maintained in one place.
    </p><p>
	Being inspired by the BSD style makefile approach, I converted my most up to date giant
	per-project makefile into an include-able makefile fragment and spent some time defining 
	the interface a bit more generically than I'd done in the past.  Since that time I've
	used the result, LaTeX-Mk, for the last few documents at school, some papers I've worked on 
	since then and also for work related documentation.  So far, the makefile framework has
	proven to be very useful and a big time saver for me.  Since I believe in open-source
	software I felt it was appropriate to document my efforts and provide a packaged solution
	that others could also use.

    <H2>The Modern Era of LaTeX-Mk</H2>
    <H3>Version 0.9</H3>
    <p>
    Released on 2002-10-09, this was the first public release of LaTeX-Mk.  My reason for using 0.9
    instead of 1.0 is that LaTeX-Mk has not been tested or used much by others yet.  Even though
    it works well for me, as with any product, I'm sure others will quickly find other ways to
    use it that I had not anticipated.  My goal is to collect feedback over the first few months
    of public consumption and come out with a 1.0 version which incorporates the primary improvements.
    </p>

    <H3>Version 0.9.1</H3>
    <p>
    This is a bug fix version which was released on 2002-10-29.  The significant changes over the previous
    version are:
    <UL>
    <LI> Per-document Xfig dependencies are now supported.  This was
         an oversight in the previous version.</LI>
    <LI> A big non-portable GNU make hack has been removed.  Starting with this
         version of LaTeX-Mk, you will need version 3.80 or newer of GNU make
         (run <code>gmake --version</code> to check your GNU make version) if you are
         using the GNU make interface to LaTeX-Mk.  The new implementation is
         much cleaner and should continue to work with all newer versions of GNU
         make.</LI>
    </UL>
    </p>

    <H3>Version 1.0</H3>
    <p>
    This is the long awaited 1.0 release!  Hopefully LaTeX-Mk can be considered
    production/stable at this point.  This release was made on 2003-02-26.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are: 
    <UL>
    <LI> Support for <a href="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm">dvipdfm</a> is
    included.  By setting the USE_DVIPDFM variable, the
    <a href="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm">dvipdfm</a> program can be used to
    generate pdf files from the dvi file generated by LaTeX.
    </LI>
    <LI> Support for PDFLaTeX is
    included.  By setting the USE_PDFLATEX variable, the
    <code>pdflatex</code> program can be used to
    generate pdf files directly from the TeX sources.
    </LI>
    <LI> A testsuite is now included.  This has resulted in the fixing of a handful of small
    bugs and should greatly contribute to the reliability and stability of this tool.</LI>
    <LI> Bugs related to processing multiple directories listed in TGIFDIRS and XFIGDIRS have
    been fixed.</LI>
    <LI> Bugs related to per-project processing of foo_TGIFDIRS and foo_XFIGDIRS have been fixed.
    </LI>
    <LI> A bug in latex-mk (the script) relating to BibTeX has been
    fixed.  Previously, after a BibTeX run, latex-mk failed to run
    LaTeX the correct number of times.
    </LI>
    </UL>
    </p>

    <H3>Version 1.1</H3>
    <p>
    LaTeX-Mk version 1.1 was released on June 15, 2003.
    This is the "HTML Support" release.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
    <LI>Support for HTML output.  Either LaTeX2HTML or HeVeA may be used.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed a bug where bibtex was not run sometimes when it needed to
    be run.  This problem showed up with some versions of LaTeX.</LI>

    <LI>Added a POST_BIBTEX_HOOK variable which specifies a program to be
    run after a BibTeX run.  This gives users the ability to insert an
    additional processing step if desired.</LI>
    </UL>
    </p>

    <H3>Version 1.2</H3>
    <p>
    LaTeX-Mk version 1.2 was released on March 21, 2004.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
	<LI>Fixed a bug which prevented the POST_BIBTEX_HOOK hook from
	actually doing anything.</LI>

    	<LI>Dropped -Ppdf from the default DVIPS_FLAGS.  Users who wish
	to keep -Ppdf as part of DVIPS_FLAGS can add it to the site
	configuration file, user configuration file, or project Makefile.
	</LI>

	<LI>Added DVIPDFM_ENV variable for running <tt>dvipdfm</tt> inside
	a customized environment. </LI>

	<LI>Preliminary Rich Text Format (RTF) output support.
	The new <tt>rtf</tt> target will use <tt>latex2rtf</tt> to produce an
	RTF version of your document.  Use this when sending your documents
	to the text-formatter-challenged.</LI>

	<LI>Fixed a bug where a list of figures, list of tables, and
	table of contents were sometimes not fully up to date in the final
	output.</LI>

	<LI>Added support for using ImageMagick to convert JPEG and PNG
	files to EPS for inclusion in a document.</LI>
    </UL>
    </p>

    <H3>Version 1.3</H3>
    <p>
    LaTeX-Mk version 1.3 was released on May 29, 2004.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
	<LI>Fixed a bug which prevented BibTeX from being run in the case
	where the source document did not have explicit \cite{} commands
	but rather used \nocite{}.  Bug report #927068.</LI>

	<LI>Fixed some file names in the examples/ directory to avoid a 
	file name clash on file systems which are not case sensitive.  This
	should fix a long standing bug where latex-mk would not build under
	cywgin.  Bug report #946216.</LI>

    </UL>
    </p>


    <H3>Version 1.4</H3>
    <P>
    LaTeX-Mk version 1.4 was released on October 4, 2005.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
        <LI>Added support for lgrind.</LI>

        <LI>Added a <tt>dist</tt> target for creating a distribution archive
        of all source files.</LI>

        <LI>Added support for using tex2page for html output.</LI>

        <LI>When using pdflatex, directly convert tgif and xfig drawings
        to PDF instead of to encapsulated postscript.</LI>

        <LI>When using pdflatex, do not create @file{.dvi} files as part
        of the default target.</LI>

        <LI>Added a LANDSCAPE variable which when set will add landscape
        flags to various tools.</LI>

        <LI>Make the default flag for exporting xfig drawings to encapsulated
        postscript be <tt>-L eps</tt> instead of <tt>-L ps</tt>.</LI>
    </UL>
    </P>

    <H3>Version 1.5</H3>
    <P>
    LaTeX-Mk version 1.5 was released on January 28, 2006.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
        <LI>
	When using tex2page or HeVeA for html output, do not force the
	running of LaTeX.  With latex2html, LaTeX will still be run because
	latex2html makes use of the <tt>.aux<tt> files generated by LaTeX.
	</LI>
        <LI>
	Fixed a bug where if the BibTeX input file was modified LaTeX would
	be run again but not BibTeX.
	</LI>
        <LI>
	Added a --tex2page mode for <code>latex-mk</code> (the script) which
	allows <code>latex-mk</code> to run tex2page the appropriate number
	of times to resolves all references.
	</LI>
	<LI>
	Improve the cleaning of tex2page generated output.
	</LI>
        <LI>
	Added <code>latex.subdir.mk</code> to support recursive builds.
	</LI>
    </UL>
    </P>
