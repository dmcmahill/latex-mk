    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20060609">LaTeX-Mk-1.7 Released</A></H2>
    <P> 
    June 09, 2006.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.7 has been released.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:  
    <UL>
        <LI>
        Added support for makeindex.  Suggested by Antoine Reilles who provided a preliminary
        patch.
        </LI> 
        <LI> 
        Added a --help flag to the latex-mk script and documented the script a bit more
        there.  It seems that some users are using the latex-mk script only and not the makefile
        system.  Suggested by Reuben Thomas.
        </LI> 
        <LI>
        Added the ability in the latex-mk script to work with a read only current directory
        and use the TEXMFOUTPUT environment variable to control where the real output goes.
        Suggested by Reuben Thomas.
        </LI>
    </UL>
    </P> 


    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20060404">LaTeX-Mk-1.6 Released</A></H2>
    <P>
    April 04, 2006.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.6 has been released.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
        <LI>
        Fix a syntax error in the (not used yet) ieee-copyout script.
        </LI>
        <LI>
        Fix a bug in the <tt>latex-mk</tt> script when BibTex is used.
        </LI>
        <LI>
        Add quoting of command names in the BSD makefiles.  This will
        properly deal with pathnames to the programs which contain spaces.
        Currently GNU make will not properly deal with this.
        </LI>
    </UL>
    </P>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20060128">LaTeX-Mk-1.5 Released</A></H2>
    <P>
    January 28, 2006.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.5 has been released.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
        <LI>
        When using tex2page or HeVeA for html output, do not force the      
        running of LaTeX.  With latex2html, LaTeX will still be run because 
        latex2html makes use of the <tt>.aux</tt> files generated by LaTeX.  
        </LI>
        <LI>
	Fixed a bug where if the BibTeX input file was modified LaTeX would
	be run again but not BibTeX.
        </LI>
        <LI>
	Added a --tex2page mode for <code>latex-mk</code> (the script) which
	allows <code>latex-mk</code> to run tex2page the appropriate number
	of times to resolves all references.
	</LI>
	<LI>
	Improve the cleaning of tex2page generated output.
	</LI>
	<LI>
	Added <code>latex.subdir.mk</code> to support recursive builds.
	</LI>


    </UL>
    </P>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20051004">LaTeX-Mk-1.4 Released</A></H2>
    <P>
    October 4, 2005.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.4 has been released.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
        <LI>Added support for lgrind.</LI>

        <LI>Added a <tt>dist</tt> target for creating a distribution archive
        of all source files.</LI>

        <LI>Added support for using tex2page for html output.</LI>

        <LI>When using pdflatex, directly convert tgif and xfig drawings
        to PDF instead of to encapsulated postscript.</LI>

        <LI>When using pdflatex, do not create @file{.dvi} files as part
        of the default target.</LI>

        <LI>Added a LANDSCAPE variable which when set will add landscape
        flags to various tools.</LI>

        <LI>Make the default flag for exporting xfig drawings to encapsulated
        postscript be <tt>-L eps</tt> instead of <tt>-L ps</tt>.</LI>
    </UL>
    </P>
   

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20040529">LaTeX-Mk-1.3 Released</A></H2>
    <P>
    May 29, 2004.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.3 has been released.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
        <LI>Fixed a bug which prevented BibTeX from being run in the case
        where the source document did not have explicit \cite{} commands
        but rather used \nocite{}.  Bug report #927068.</LI>                          
    
        <LI>Fixed some file names in the examples/ directory to avoid a 
        file name clash on file systems which are not case sensitive.  This
        should fix a long standing bug where latex-mk would not build under
        cywgin.  Bug report #946216.</LI>                            
    </UL>
    </P>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20040321">LaTeX-Mk-1.2 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    March 21, 2004.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.2 has been released.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
	<LI>Fixed a bug which prevented the POST_BIBTEX_HOOK hook from
	actually doing anything.</LI>

    	<LI>Dropped -Ppdf from the default DVIPS_FLAGS.  Users who wish
	to keep -Ppdf as part of DVIPS_FLAGS can add it to the site
	configuration file, user configuration file, or project Makefile.
	</LI>

	<LI>Added DVIPDFM_ENV variable for running <tt>dvipdfm</tt> inside
	a customized environment. </LI>

	<LI>Preliminary Rich Text Format (RTF) output support.
	The new <tt>rtf</tt> target will use <tt>latex2rtf</tt> to produce an
	RTF version of your document.  Use this when sending your documents
	to the text-formatter-challenged.</LI>

	<LI>Fixed a bug where a list of figures, list of tables, and
	table of contents were sometimes not fully up to date in the final
	output.</LI>

	<LI>Added support for using ImageMagick to convert JPEG and PNG
	files to EPS for inclusion in a document.</LI>  
    </UL>
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20030615">LaTeX-Mk-1.1 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    June 15, 2003.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.1 has been released.
    This is the "HTML Support" release.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
    <LI>Support for HTML output.  Either LaTeX2HTML or HeVeA may be used.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed a bug where bibtex was not run sometimes when it needed to
    be run.  This problem showed up with some versions of LaTeX.</LI>

    <LI>Added a POST_BIBTEX_HOOK variable which specifies a program to be
    run after a BibTeX run.  This gives users the ability to insert an
    additional processing step if desired.</LI>
    </UL>
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20030326">LaTeX-Mk-1.0 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    February 26, 2003.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.0 has been released.
    This release adds support for using <a
    href="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm">dvipdfm</a> for
    generating PDF output directly from the DVI files as well as
    support for using PDFLaTeX.  In addition, a testsuite of over 50
    checks on the makefile code has been added resulting in the
    elimination of a handful of bugs.  This should prove useful going
    forward as more tests are added and as a means for regression
    testing. 
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20021029">LaTeX-Mk-0.9.1 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    October 29, 2002.  LaTeX-Mk version 0.9.1 has been released.  This is
    a bug fix release.  This release fixes some problems found when using
    GNU make.  This version of LaTeX-Mk requires GNU make version 3.80 or
    higher if you are using GNU make.  As before, a BSD compatible make
    program can be used.  In addition, per-document Xfig dependencies
    have been added.  Somehow this slipped through the cracks with the
    previous release.
    </p>
    <p>
    As always, bug reports can be filed on the 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-mk">LaTeX-Mk
    Sourceforge Project Page</a>.  Feature requests will be rolled
    into future major releases and minor releases will be reserved
    for bug fixes.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20021009">LaTeX-Mk-0.9 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    October 9, 2002.  LaTeX-Mk version 0.9 has been released.  This is
    the first public release of LaTeX-Mk.  Please try it out and let
    me know how it works out.  There are forums on the 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-mk">LaTeX-Mk
    Sourceforge Project Page</a> where you can leave comments, ask
    questions of other users and file bug reports.  I can't promise a
    quick response, but I will try and look at each report.
