    <H2><A NAME="20030615">LaTeX-Mk-1.1 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    June 15, 2003.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.1 has been released.
    This is the "HTML Support" release.
    The significant changes/additions over the previous version are:
    <UL>
    <LI>Support for HTML output.  Either LaTeX2HTML or HeVeA may be used.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed a bug where bibtex was not run sometimes when it needed to
    be run.  This problem showed up with some versions of LaTeX.</LI>

    <LI>Added a POST_BIBTEX_HOOK variable which specifies a program to be
    run after a BibTeX run.  This gives users the ability to insert an
    additional processing step if desired.</LI>
    </UL>
    </p>

    <H2><A NAME="20030326">LaTeX-Mk-1.0 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    February 26, 2003.  LaTeX-Mk version 1.0 has been released.
    This release adds support for using <a
    href="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm">dvipdfm</a> for
    generating PDF output directly from the DVI files as well as
    support for using PDFLaTeX.  In addition, a testsuite of over 50
    checks on the makefile code has been added resulting in the
    elimination of a handful of bugs.  This should prove useful going
    forward as more tests are added and as a means for regression
    testing. 
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20021029">LaTeX-Mk-0.9.1 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    October 29, 2002.  LaTeX-Mk version 0.9.1 has been released.  This is
    a bug fix release.  This release fixes some problems found when using
    GNU make.  This version of LaTeX-Mk requires GNU make version 3.80 or
    higher if you are using GNU make.  As before, a BSD compatible make
    program can be used.  In addition, per-document Xfig dependencies
    have been added.  Somehow this slipped through the cracks with the
    previous release.
    </p>
    <p>
    As always, bug reports can be filed on the 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-mk">LaTeX-Mk
    Sourceforge Project Page</a>.  Feature requests will be rolled
    into future major releases and minor releases will be reserved
    for bug fixes.
    </p>

    <HR>
    <H2><A NAME="20021009">LaTeX-Mk-0.9 Released</A></H2>
    <p>
    October 9, 2002.  LaTeX-Mk version 0.9 has been released.  This is
    the first public release of LaTeX-Mk.  Please try it out and let
    me know how it works out.  There are forums on the 
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-mk">LaTeX-Mk
    Sourceforge Project Page</a> where you can leave comments, ask
    questions of other users and file bug reports.  I can't promise a
    quick response, but I will try and look at each report.
