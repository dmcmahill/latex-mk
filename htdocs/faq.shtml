    <H2>Can I run LaTeX-Mk on my favorite operating system?</H2>
    <p>
	LaTeX-Mk is primarily developed under <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>,
	but should quite portable.  The primary requirement is a BSD 
	compatible <code>make</code> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU make</a>.
    </p>
    <H2>How can I tell if I have BSD make?</H2>
    <p>
	If you are running a BSD operating system such as <a href="http://www.netbsd.org">NetBSD</a>
	or <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a>, then you have BSD make.  If you are on another
	operating system, it is possible that someone may have installed a BSD compatible make under
	the name <code>bmake</code>.  However in this case you may wish to use GNU make to be sure that
	you have a supported make program.
    </p>

    <H2>How can I tell if I have GNU make?</H2>
    <p>
	Under some operating systems such as GNU/Linux, the program 
	called <code>make</code> is 
	often times GNU make.  To be sure, try running 
	"<code>make --version</code>".  If you
	get a message back like: <br>
	<pre>
        GNU Make 3.80
        Copyright (C) 2002  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
        This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.
        There is NO warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A
        PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
	</pre>
	Then you have GNU make.  Many times, GNU make is installed under the name "<code>gmake</code>"
	to avoid a conflict with a system supplied make.  In that case, try running "<code>gmake --version</code>"
	to see if you have a working GNU make installed under that name on your system.  Please note that
	you need at least version 3.80 of GNU make.
    </p>
    
    <H2>I have GNU make but LaTeX-Mk Doesn't Work.</H2>
    <p>
    Make sure you have at least version 3.80 or newer of GNU make.
    Try running	"<code>make --version</code>" or 
    "<code>gmake --version</code>" to figure out what version
    you have.  Unfortunately some important and powerful features did
    not exist prior to this version and it is very unlikely that I
    will figure out how to port LaTeX-Mk to older versions of GNU make.
    </p>

    <H2>I don't use *BSD but want BSD make.  How can I get it?</H2>
    <p>
	A portable snapshot of NetBSD's make can be downloaded from the files section of the
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex-mk">LaTeX-Mk Sourceforge Project Page</a>.
