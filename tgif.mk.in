# README:
#
# To use this makefile fragment, set the variable:
#	TGIFSRCS	= the tgif drawing files (.obj files)
# in your top level Makefile.  You can also specify
# TGIFDIRS which is a list of directories containing
# tgif files.  All tgif files in the specified directories
# are added to TGIFSRCS
#
# The following variables may be overridden in your top level Makefile
#
#  TGIF		= the tgif executable
#  TGIF_FLAGS	= flags passed to tgif for exporting to eps
