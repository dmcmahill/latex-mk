@chapter Introduction

Latex-Mk is a tool for automatically generating @file{Makefile.in}s from
files called @file{Makefile.am}.  Each @file{Makefile.am} is basically a
series of @code{make} macro definitions (with rules being thrown in
occasionally).  The generated @file{Makefile.in}s are compliant with the
GNU Makefile standards.

The typical Latex-Mk input file is simply a series of macro definitions.
Each such file is processed to create a @file{Makefile.in}.  There
should generally be one @file{Makefile.am} per directory of a project.
