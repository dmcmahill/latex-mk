# Format:
#
# test_name | directories to create | files to touch | arguments to make
#
# make will be called with -n just to see that the right set of steps 
# will be taken for each example.  
#
# By using the special character '@' in the 'files to touch' field,
# a pause will be inserted to help avoid any timestamp issues with
# touch being called to rapidly.
#
# Please note that more tests should be added here but that each added 
# test should have the 'golden' output fully verified by hand.
