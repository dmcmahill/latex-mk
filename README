latex-mk is a set of makefile fragments designed to assist in the
management of LaTeX documents.  The user creates a simple Makefile
which sets up a few simple variables and then includes the latex.mk
fragment at the end.  Please refer to the documentation in the doc/
subdirectory for complete documentation.

--------------------------

If you are setting the user configuration file with --with-usermakeconf
and/or --with-usergmakeconf you'll probably need to enclose the argumen
with single quotes to prevent shell expansion during configuration.  For
example,

  --with-usermakeconf=${HOME}/.latex-mk.conf

will end up hardcoding the home directory of the particular user who 
ran the configuration script.  If you are setting this up for multiple
users, you probably wanted to use

  --with-usermakeconf='${HOME}/.latex-mk.conf'

instead.
