--------------------------
Quick overview
--------------------------

latex-mk is a set of makefile fragments designed to assist in the
management of LaTeX documents.  The user creates a simple Makefile
which sets up a few simple variables and then includes the latex.mk
fragment at the end.  Please refer to the documentation in the doc/
subdirectory for complete documentation.

--------------------------
Quick install
--------------------------

If you are setting the user configuration file with --with-usermakeconf
and/or --with-usergmakeconf you'll probably need to enclose the argumen
with single quotes to prevent shell expansion during configuration.  For
example,

  --with-usermakeconf=${HOME}/.latex-mk.conf

will end up hardcoding the home directory of the particular user who 
ran the configuration script.  If you are setting this up for multiple
users, you probably wanted to use

  --with-usermakeconf='${HOME}/.latex-mk.conf'

instead.

Acknowledgements
--------------------------

Thanks to Jeff Gealow who provided an example of a makefile for a 
LaTeX document many many years ago.  Thats where this all started.

Thanks to Paul Smith and Darrin Jewell for help with GNU make.

Thanks to Todd Sepke for the suggestions that led to the latex-mk
script.

Thanks to Jeff McMahill for suggesting that I add support for
multiple top level documents with some common dependencies and
some unique dependencies.

Thanks to Karthikesh Raju for suggesting including a 'dist' target 
and for suggesting that the -draft output be supported.

Thanks to Brook Milligan for suggesting that I add HTML output,
POST_BIBTEX_HOOK, and providing general encouragement.  Brook also
suggested the sweave support.

Thanks to Antoine Reilles for suggesting that I add makeindex
support and for providing a preliminary patch.

Thanks to Reuben Thomas for suggesting that the latex-mk script
be documented a bit more for standalone use and for suggesting 
a way to have the latex-mk script work with a read only source
directory.

Thanks to Rafael Laboissiere for suggesting that the testsuite
run all shell scripts through 'sh -n' for a syntax check and for
helping to track down some testsuite failures.  Rafael has also
provided several small patches found as the Debian package 
maintainer.
