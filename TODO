LaTeX-Mk Unofficial TODO List
-----------------------------

- Support for pdftex

- Support for lgrind

- Support for recursive make calls into subdirectories which
  may or may not be strictly latex-mk projects.  This could
  potentially be used when you have some other stuff which
  needs to be run to generate some inputs.
