------------------------------
Release Notes for LaTeX-Mk-1.8
------------------------------

- Fix a syntax error in the latex-mk script which showed up with some shells.

- Fix a bug in the latex-mk script where some of the ".old" files that are used
  for determining when to re-run various tools were not being cleaned up properly.

- Add a few more files which latex and makeindex may generate to the list of files
  removed by the 'clean' target.

- Add a testsuite entry for the clean target.

- Improve the makefile testsuite robustness.  In particular it now deals with
  the bmake program having different names (make, bmake, bsdmake, etc).

- Improve and expand the testsuite for the latex-mk script.

------------------------------
Release Notes for LaTeX-Mk-1.7
------------------------------

- Added support for makeindex.  Suggested by Antoine Reilles who provided a preliminary
patch.

- Added a --help flag to the latex-mk script and documented the script a bit more
there.  It seems that some users are using the latex-mk script only and not the makefile
system.  Suggested by Reuben Thomas.

- Added the ability in the latex-mk script to work with a read only current directory 
and use the TEXMFOUTPUT environment variable to control where the real output goes.
Suggested by Reuben Thomas.
