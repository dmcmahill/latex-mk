Release Notes for LaTeX-Mk-1.7
------------------------------

- Added support for makeindex.  Suggested by Antoine Reilles who provided a preliminary
patch.

- Added a --help flag to the latex-mk script and documented the script a bit more
there.  It seems that some users are using the latex-mk script only and not the makefile
system.  Suggested by Reuben Thomas.

- Added the ability in the latex-mk script to work with a read only current directory 
and use the TEXMFOUTPUT environment variable to control where the real output goes.
Suggested by Reuben Thomas.
