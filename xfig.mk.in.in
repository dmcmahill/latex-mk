# To use this makefile fragment, set the variable:
#	XFIGSRCS	= the xfig drawing files (.fig files)
# in your top level Makefile.  You can also specify
# XFIGDIRS which is a list of directories containing
# xfig files.  All tgif files in the specified directories
# are added to XFIGSRCS
#
# The following variables may be overridden in your top level Makefile
#
#  XFIG			= the xfig executable
#  FIG2DEV_FLAGS	= flags passed to fig2dev for exporting to eps
