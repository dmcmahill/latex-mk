# This Makefile fragment is included at the very end of users custom
# Makefiles in subdirectories of a top level latex-mk Makefile.  This
# makes sure the standard set of targets exist so a recursive make
# will not fail due to undefined targets

# An example is:
#
# SUBDIR+=	document1
# SUBDIR+=	document2
# SUBDIR+=	document3
BMK:# .include "/path/to/latex.subdir.mk"
GMK:# include /path/to/latex.subdir.gmk
#


# note:  we put "default" first because when we do not specify a target
# we want to use "default" because thats what latex.mk has for its own
# default
